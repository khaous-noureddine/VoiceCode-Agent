## 🚀 Overview

VoiceCode Agent enables hands-free interaction with development workflows.  
Users speak naturally, the system understands intent, decides whether an action is required, and either responds verbally or executes a coding-related task.

The assistant is built around a strict separation of concerns:
- Speech understanding
- Decision-making
- Execution
- Speech synthesis

This design ensures reliability, safety, and extensibility.
